# Wait for Element
`waitForElement` is a JavaScript utility function that allows developers to wait for a specific HTML element to be available in the DOM. It provides a simple and efficient way to handle scenarios where elements are generated dynamically on the frontend, enabling developers to bind events or perform operations on these elements as soon as they become available.

## Purpose
In complex projects where HTML elements are generated dynamically, developers often face challenges when they need to interact with these elements using JavaScript. `waitForElement` solves this problem by waiting until the desired element is present in the DOM, allowing developers to perform actions such as event binding or other operations seamlessly.

## Use Cases
- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Use `waitForElement` to wait for dynamically loaded content to appear in the DOM before performing any actions.
- **Single Page Applications:** Ideal for SPAs where content changes dynamically, ensuring smooth interaction with newly loaded elements.
- **Testing:** Useful in automated testing scenarios where waiting for specific elements before performing assertions is necessary.

## Example Usage

### Basic Example
```javascript
// Wait for an element with ID "myElement" to be available in the DOM
waitForElement('#myElement')
    .then(element => {
        // Perform operations on the element once it is available
        element.textContent = 'Element found and modified!';
    });
```
### Usage with Async/Await
When working with asynchronous operations, you can use **async/await** to make your code more readable and concise. Here's how you can use `waitForElement` with **async/await**:
```javascript
async function performAsyncTask() {
    const element = await waitForElement('.dynamicElement');
    // Do something with the element
}
performAsyncTask();
